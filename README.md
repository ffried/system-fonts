# Fonts

This is a sample app that lists all available fonts (retrieved using `UIFont`).
The following features are currently avaliable:

- List all fonts
- Search for fonts
- Select a font and write text with it in different sizes.

The app is universal and runs on iPhone and iPads. It requires at least iOS 9.0.
